= Upsell Plus

Please do not confuse with "similar products" or "taxonomies". 

** Specification **

This extension is a sales tool intended to allow Sales and Product
Manaters to make one-to-many links between for specific reasons.

The initial reasons being implement are:

1) Upsell - where if a potential customer is viewing a product an inviation
to investigate a more profitable product is offered. An example would be
to let them know there is a "Deluxe" version of the same product.

You should never see a product linked to by an upsell point back to anything less profitable. 

2) Cros Sell - where a potential customer is offered alternatives to the
product being viewed. For valid sales and marketing reasons, these choices
could link to each other or perhaps create several paths for the customer to explore. For example, the marketing manager for a particular swimsuit may want to keep suggestions within a particular theme such as style or color or season.

For this reason, although you may see cross sell products linking to each other, it is something the sales or marketing people did intentionally, not simply the result of them being taxonomically similar.

3) Complementary products - are intended as follow-on purchase opportunities. Typically they would be displayed when a customer adds a product to a cart. They may be marginally related to the product being purchased. For example when a customer adds a swimsuit to the cart they are presented with suggestions for beach towels, sunglasses and sunscreen.

** Implementation **

And of course, TBD.
